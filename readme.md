## Codeclan: Project 2 - Seek Truth

[This project is hosted at BLANK]()

This app is the result of my week 9 group project, for CodeClan's professional software development course. The MEVN stack was used to create a puzzle based web app to be used as a marketinng tool for local events.

The idea is that - 
In the vain of Cicada 3301 and GCHQ's "Can you find it?". And events like the Puzzled Pint.
Word of mouth, social media discussions
Also offers the possibility to  bring attention to events at unsual locations.

The landing page of the web app is deliberately built against UX principles to pose a challenge to the user. After solving the riddle and entering the password, the user is directed to an event details page.
